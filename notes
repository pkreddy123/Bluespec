MAC.bsv: Useless

MULT_wrapper: As we are using verilog multifinal files which mapas multiplications to DSP blocks we use this wrapper
	
multfinal:Verilog files that is used for multiplication

BRAM:Code to use BRam

for using while static values should be used
Otherwise there will a pblm as the loop does not terminate
Stacksize error

Hardware  design considerations:
	
	The circuit should work such that even if the host stops sending the data,the circuit should not stall.

	There should reset option .Once the image data is processed , The fpga should reset such that in can process the new data again.

	The Architecture should be designed with modular circuits.It should not be monolithic(Single design).Each and every module should be checked for all thetest cases.

	 Bram should be used for memory storage.Wrapper should be better to use so that an friendly interface can be created to interact.

	The testbench should be made to behave exactly as the host.All design constraints should be checked using testbench otherwise your code might not work exactly on fpga.

	Larger size FIFO should be design using BRam .Small FIFOS can be made using registers.

	Rather than storing the whole data on fpga better to use streaming of data.

	FPGA has three important components.DSP blocks,CLB blocks and BRam memory cells.

	Better to use FIFOs as buffers.
